## Uses
An app is basically a bunch of components that are combined together. The Components are in the Palette
## Purpose 
To gain an understanding of how to build a basic app
## Goals
  1. Create and have a functioning paint pot app
  2. Start working on an app that you can continue to work on '
## Challenges 
  1. Create an AppInventor account
  2. Be able to successfully navigate the palette and blocks
  3. Create a working app
## Cheat Sheet
- Palette: The Palette is on the far left side of the Component Designer. The Palette is the place where you get all the components that you can use to create your app
- Viewer: The Viewer is the place that you drag your components into. The Viewer shows you what your app will look like on a phone
- Components List: The Components List is to the right of the Viewer. The Components List is a list of all the components you are using
- Properties:The Properties are to the far right side. Properties are different parts of a component
- Media: Media components are images, songs, and videos that you can put into your app
- Blocks: Blocks are the commands or instructions that you will use to make your app do things. The Blocks are located to the far left side
- Control (Event Listeners): Event listeners are the yellow colored blocks. The "Control" drawer is located on the left side of the screen in the “Blocks” section. When you click on the “Control” drawer, you will find blocks with the word “when”. These blocks are called. Event Listeners. Event Listeners are the blocks that let you decide when a certain action or event occurs.
- Variables: Variables are the Orange colored blocks. Variables are objects that have not been given a value yet
- Procedures: Procedures are the purple colored blocks. Procedures are the types of blocks that allow you to make actions happen. Procedure blocks have the words “do” or “call”
- Parameters and Arguments: Parameters are the names of variables waiting to receive value. Arguments are the values that are sent to parameters
- Global and Local variables: Global variables are variables that are accessible by all event listeners and procedures. Local variables are variables that are only accessible by one event listener or procedure
